# serotonin_errors
This module was created solely for fun and ease of the process of catching and fixing bugs. It's an exception handler which displays custom error messages generated by a built-in (obviously customizable) function. The resulting error message looks the same as an original one, just with some changes to error text.

# Usage
* Insert phrases you want to be displayed into 3 arrays (depending on what place in the sentence you want the phrase to be inserted into).
* Then in your main file add the following lines:
```
import sys
sys.excepthook = handle_exception
```
